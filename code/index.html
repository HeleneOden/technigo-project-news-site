     </figure>
     <p> 
        The Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis, are a natural light display that occurs in polar regions. They are caused by the interaction of charged particles from the sun with the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere. The result is a stunning array of colors, including green, pink, purple, and blue, dancing across the night sky.
        The best time to see the Northern Lights is during the winter months when the nights are long and dark.
